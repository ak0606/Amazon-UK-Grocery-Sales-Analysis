# Amazon UK Grocery Sales Analysis PowerBi Dashboard
## Introduction
This project analyzes the performance of products in the Amazon UK Grocery category using an interactive, multi-page Power BI dashboard. It provides a comprehensive view of key business metrics such as sales, revenue, pricing trends, and product performance across various categories. By leveraging rich visualisations, the dashboard empowers stakeholders to uncover meaningful insights and make informed decisions. Whether optimizing inventory, refining pricing strategies, or evaluating product success, this tool equips decision-makers with the data needed to drive growth and efficiency in a competitive marketplace.
## Source of Data
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle, providing an extensive overview of Amazon grocery products. It captures key statistics such as sales, revenue, product ratings, Best Seller Rank (BSR), and more, collected through the Helium10 tool. This rich dataset allows for in-depth analysis across multiple product categories and brands. 
## Data Preprocessing
For this dashboard project, data preprocessing was performed in Python to ensure clean, reliable data. This included handling null values, standardizing brand and category entries, and using NLP techniques like fuzzy matching with FuzzyWuzzy to correct brand name inconsistencies. You can access the Python Jupyter Notebook file used for data preprocessing by [clicking here](./Data_Preprocessing).
